### Tasks

_**0. Listen**_
Write a program that opens an `IPv4/TCP` socket, and listens to traffic on port `12345` (Any address).

_**1. Accept**_
Write a program that opens an `IPv4/TCP` socket, and listens to traffic on port `12345` (Any address).

_**2. Client**_
Write a program that connects to a listening server.

_**3. Roger**_
Write a program that opens an `IPv4/TCP` socket, and listens to traffic on port `12345` (Any address).

_**4. REST API - The Request**_
Write a program that opens an `IPv4/TCP` socket, and listens to traffic on port `8080` (Any address).

_**5. REST API - Queries**_
Write a program that opens an `IPv4/TCP` socket, and listens to traffic on port `8080` (Any address).

_**6. REST API - Headers**_
Write a program that opens an `IPv4/TCP` socket, and listens to traffic on port `8080` (Any address).

_**7. REST API - Body parameters**_
Write a program that opens an `IPv4/TCP` socket, and listens to traffic on port `8080` (Any address).

_**8. REST API - Create TODO**_
Now that you can parse an HTTP request, itâ€™s time to implement our REST API. Start by handling the `POST` method for the path `/todos`

_**9. REST API - Retrieve all TODOs**_
Handle the `GET` method for the path `/todos`
