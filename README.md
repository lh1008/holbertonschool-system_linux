## System programming & Algorithm ― Linux programming

### Linux and C programming

This first part of the low-level curriculum is an extension of Holberton’s Foundations. Students will extend their knowledge of the C programming language and the Linux system throughout more complex projects.

Those advanced concepts include but are not limited to:

- File streams
- The Linux programming interface: system calls
- Memory management
- Process Tracing
- IPC: Inter-Process Communication
- The ELF file format
- Assembly with Intel x86
- The Linux filesystem
